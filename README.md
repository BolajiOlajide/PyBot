# PyBot

My attempt at creating a slack bot with Python.

### Installation
- Create a virtual environment and activate it
- I assume you already have `Python3` installed, if this isn't the case download it [here](https://python.org)
- Install the project dependencies with the command `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Create your `.env` file that includes the details available in the `.env.sample` gotten from your sample channel

### Reference
I followed this [tutorial](https://www.fullstackpython.com/blog/build-first-slack-bot-python.html) and [this one](https://medium.com/@nidhog/how-to-make-a-chatbot-on-slack-with-python-82015517f19c) to build this. It is detailed and you should check it out if you want to build your own slack bot.
